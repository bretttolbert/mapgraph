Ideas for use:
    1. As a single-choice menu. 
        MapGraph is initialized with an action URL. 
        User clicks specified node and is redirected to the action URL with a param to indicate which node was selected.

    2. As a multiple-choice menu.
        MapGraph is intialized with an action URL.
        User clicks one or more nodes and a "Submit" button. 
        
    3. As a dynamic graph - manual coloring
        MapGraph is initialized with one or more named data sets. 
        Each data set has a name, e.g. "2013 Population Density".
        For each data set, each node has a data value and a fill color. 
        A select box is generated allowing the user to dynamically select the desired data set. 
        When user hovers over a node, the node name and data value is displayed.
        
    4. As a dynamic graph - automatic coloring
        Same as 4, but MapGraph automatically generates the fill colors based on the data.
        By default, it will use a color scale which goes from purple, blue, teal, green, yellow, orange, red.
        Using normal distribution.
